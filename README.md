# Road Segmentation with U-Net in PyTorch

This project aims to automatically identify and extract road networks from aerial images using deep learning. It leverages the U-Net architecture, a powerful convolutional neural network designed for image segmentation tasks, and implements it within the PyTorch framework.

## Project Purpose

The core objective is to develop a robust model capable of accurately segmenting roads in aerial imagery. This capability has significant practical implications across diverse fields like:

- **Urban Planning:** Assisting in road network analysis and infrastructure development.
- **Map Creation:** Automating the extraction of road data for generating accurate maps.
- **Autonomous Navigation:** Enabling self-driving vehicles to perceive and navigate road environments.

## Approach

The code employs a U-Net model, pre-trained on a large image dataset, and fine-tunes it on a subset of the Massachusetts Roads Dataset, which contains aerial images and corresponding road segmentation masks.  

To enhance the model's performance and generalization ability, it incorporates image augmentation techniques, introducing variations in the training data. This helps the model learn to identify roads under different lighting conditions, perspectives, and image quality.

The training process involves optimizing the model's parameters to minimize a loss function, guiding it to accurately predict road pixels in the images. The model's accuracy is then evaluated using the Intersection over Union (IoU) metric, a standard measure for segmentation quality.

## Key Components

- **U-Net Architecture:**  A convolutional neural network known for its effectiveness in image segmentation, particularly in biomedical applications, but well-suited for road extraction due to its ability to capture both local and global image features.
- **PyTorch Framework:** A popular deep learning library chosen for its flexibility, dynamic computation graph, and ease of use, facilitating model development and training.
- **Massachusetts Roads Dataset:** A publicly available dataset of aerial images and road masks used for training and evaluating the model's performance.
- **Image Augmentation:** Techniques used to create variations in the training images, such as rotations, flips, and color adjustments, improving the model's ability to generalize to unseen data.
- **Intersection over Union (IoU):** A metric used to quantify the accuracy of the segmentation by comparing the predicted road pixels to the ground truth masks.

## Potential Impacts

This project demonstrates a practical approach for road segmentation using deep learning. The resulting model can serve as a valuable tool for automating road extraction from aerial imagery, supporting various applications in urban planning, map generation, and autonomous navigation systems.
